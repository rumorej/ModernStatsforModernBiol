#Chapter 0-1 Tasks

#Work through Tasks/ Questions listed in Chapter 1

##Note 
#dbinom provides the probability of getting a result for a specific point on the binomial distribution
#pbinom calculates the cumulative probability of getting a result equal to or below that point on the distribution


#Look at the factor function
?factor

#Bernoulli Trials
#rbinom(n= #of trials, prob = probability, size = 1[always the case for bernoulli])

#Question 1.2
rbinom(15, 1, 0.5)
#Successes and failures can have unequal probabilities in a Bernoulli trial, as long as the probabilities sum to 1

rbinom(12, 1, 2/3)
# 1 indicates successes (i.e., landed in right-hand box) and 0 zero denotes left-hand box

#Binomial Succes Counts
#Only care about how many balls go into right-hand box
#Order doesn't matter

rbinom(1, prob = 2/3, size = 12)

#Number of successes in a Bernoulli trial with a probability of success of 0.3 is called a binomial random variable
#B(15, 0.3)

set.seed(235569515)
rbinom(1, prob = 0.3, size = 15)
# Question 1.3: Repeat Function 10 times and report most common outcome
#Most common outcome was 5

#Probability Mass Distribution
pvec <- dbinom(0:15, prob = 0.3, size = 15)
round(pvec,2)

#Plot the prob dist
barplot(pvec, names.arg = 0:15, col = "purple")

#Question 1.4
dbinom(4, size = 4, prob = 2/3)

#Poisson Distribution
#Use when the probability of succes p is small and the number of trials n is large; can approx. the binomal dist

#Question 1.5

Mu <- 10000 * 0.0005

#Simulate a mutation process along 10,000 positions with a mutations rate of 5x10^-4

#Task
#ppois(6, 0.5, lower.tail = FALSE)
#if lower.tail is TRUE (default), probabilities are P[X â‰¤ x], otherwise, P[X > x] if FALSE


##Multinomial
#More than two outcomes

##Generate a random number variable with four levels
